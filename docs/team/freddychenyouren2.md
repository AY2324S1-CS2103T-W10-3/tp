### Project: ToothTracker

### Overview

ToothTracker, an all-in-one solution for Front Desk Dental Clinic Administrative Staff to manage patient and dentist records efficiently.
You can interact with ToothTracker via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
along with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
ToothTracker is written in Java and only Java 11 supports ToothTracker.
ToothTracker is optimized for fast-typers interacting with it through CLI.
With ToothTracker, you can add new student and dentist profiles, delete records, and even list all available profiles in the database, all with just a few simple commands!


### Summary of my contributions
* **New Feature**: Added the ability for receptionists to add, edit, and list dentists.
  * What it does: The receptionist will be able to add details of a dentist practising in the dental clinic.
  * Justification: This feature is a critical backbone of ToothTracker as it is the starting point for more functionalities relating to dentists. The dental clinic must be able to track the dentist profiles to assign suitable dentists to patients.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects dentist commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design such as handling parameters. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature [Coming Soon]**: Added the ability to see the cost of different types of dental treatments.
